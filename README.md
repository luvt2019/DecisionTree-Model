# DecisionTree-Model
Practice model exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com to characterize the type of people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying an investor back. Created a model that helped predict which borrowers investors would want to invest in.

Used lending data from 2007-2010 to try to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. Data has been cleaned of NA values.
